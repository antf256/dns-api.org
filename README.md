DNS-API.org
-----------

This repository contains the code for a simple daemon which provides
an online DNS-lookup service.

The service responds to request received via HTTP with a JSON-encoded
response, in the event of error this response will be empty.


Implementation
--------------

Almost all parts of this code are trivial.
